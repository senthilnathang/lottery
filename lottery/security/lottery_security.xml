        There are 4 groups
        The way the groups work is different when `account_accountant` is installed or not.

        Invoicing only:
        ```
         group_account_invoice ⇨ group_account_manager   (only those two should be used)
                               ⬂
        group_account_readonly ⇨ group_account_user      (those two are only visible through a server action)
        ```

        Invoicing + Accounting:
        ```
         group_account_invoice ⬂
        group_account_readonly ⇨ group_account_user ⇨ group_account_manager
        ```
        `group_account_user` is almost (a bit more than) the sum of `group_account_invoice` and `group_account_readonly`
        `group_account_manager` is the king (except when Consolidation is installed, then there is a super-king)

        `group_account_invoice` can create/edit invoices, refunds, payments, etc but cannot see accounting related stuff (journal entries, reports, reconciliation,...)
        `group_account_readonly` can see (and only see) everything, including the journal entries, advanced configuration, reports
        `group_account_user`  is the accountant: he can do everything except advanced config (accounting periods for instance)
        `group_account_manager` can edit some config that `group_account_user` cannot do

        When you have only Invoicing installed, only `group_account_invoice` and `group_account_manager` should be used. The others are giving a shallow access to Accounting features, but we want to remove that.
